Issues and pull requests are welcome.

- **Where a fix goes.** Anything that isn't specific to Midway Arcade Origins (HLE
  modules, the RSX renderer, the lifters) belongs in
  [ps3recomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/ps3recomp), which follows the shared
  house style. This repo holds only the build configuration, docs and anything
  genuinely title-specific.
- **No game material.** Don't commit or attach dumps, EBOOTs, ROM sets (`*.SR`), keys, RAPs,
  lifted or decompiled source, or extracted assets, and that includes test
  fixtures and logs that embed them. Screenshots of the running port are fine.
- **Show it running.** A rendering or boot fix comes with a before/after frame
  (`LD_FRAME_DUMP`) or the log lines that changed, and an entry in
  `docs/progress.md` saying what the cause was.
- **Commits.** Imperative subject line, and a body that explains *why* when
  the change isn't obvious. Add an `Unreleased` entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
